          <h2>Monochrome Artworks</h2>
        </a>
        <p>
          When I joined the NFT space, my sole focus was monochrome pictures.<br>
          I'll always have a love for this, as it feels as the raw core of an
          illustrations. Despite the complexity you can attain with it,
          there's only two elements: black and white.

        <h2>Colored Artworks</h2>
        </a> 
        <p>
          As time went on I wanted to take things a little bit further by embracing colors.<br>
          Originally when I started digital art, I was actually much better at handling coloring
          than other part of an illustration such as lineart. It's only over time that I became
          gradually better at lineart to the point where I am today, and I intend to make the best
          of these 2 skills by combining the knowledge accumulated.

        <h2>Creative Coding</h2>
        </a>
        <p>It is not limited to that though. I am a developer first.<br>
          While I do not always feel the urge
          to code at home, the discovery of code as an artform added another tool to my set that I enjoy
          using, although sparsely because of how tied it feels to work.
